# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
Project to review the MechaCar's production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team. Using your knowledge of R, youâ€™ll design a linear model that predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes using several variables from the MechaCar_mpg.csv file

 ## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
 
- Write a short summary using a screenshot of the output from the linear regression, and address the following questions:
- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
